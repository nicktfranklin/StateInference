# State-Inference and Planning
This project is a work in progress and explores both state-inference and value iteration in reinforcement learning problems. 

## Description of Notebooks
* `State_Inference_Network.ipynb`: Simulations of a discrete-VAE state-inference network.  Proof of concenpt in a toy domain.
* `Value Iteration.ipynb`: Contains simulations of a neurally-plausible value iteration algorithm in a gridworld with a restricted transition structure.  Shows how reward propogates in a 1D and 2D setting. 
* `MCTS.ipynb`: Contains simulations of an implementation of Monte-Carlo Tree Search in a stochastic domain with bottleneck states.  Contains simulations demonstrating this as a failure case for MCTS
* `Successor Representation.ipynb`: Contains simulations of the during transition and reward revaluation.
* `Rooms Problem`: Incomplete.
